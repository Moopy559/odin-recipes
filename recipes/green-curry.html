        <h2>
            A famous Thai dish known for it's 
            fragrance and iconic green colour
        </h2>
            It has a less “in your face” flavour 
            compared to Thai Red Curry but it's more 
            fragrant with chilli than Thai Yellow Curry. 
            Creamy, sweet, and salty. But all too often, 
            Thai takeout places make it far too sweet!
